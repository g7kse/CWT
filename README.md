# CWT Lookup

I don't use N1MM logger and the current version of Not1MM doesn't see to lookup form a list of callsigns for the CWT. This little application loads the csv and then allows the user to lookup the callsign and return the name and membership number. Useful for checking that you heard correctly :-)

There are a couple of versions here.

1. CWOps.py - This is a command line application. Just download the code and make sure the CSV file is in the same directory and has the same title. Launch it with ``python3 CWOPs.py``
2. CWT.py - An attempt at a GUI version that looks awful but loads the CSV ahead of doing the sam task. Same rules as above but launch it with ``python3 CWT.py``


Note: These aren't expertly coded and crafted. I pinched code and used a helper to get where I got (that doesn't really make sense but you know what I mean). If you want to use and improve, feel free.

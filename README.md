# CWT Lookup

I don't use N1MM logger and the current version of Not1MM doesn't see to lookup form a list of callsigns for the CWT. This little application loads the csv and then allows the user to lookup the callsign and return the name and membership number. Useful for checking that you heard correctly :-)
